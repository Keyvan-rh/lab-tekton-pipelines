Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
--------------------------------------------------

A continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is an automated expression
of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
Every change to your software (i.e. committed in source control) goes through a complex
process on its way to being released. This process involves building the software in a
reliable and repeatable manner as well as progressing the built software (called a "build")
through multiple stages of testing and deployment.

Kubernetes
----------

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management
of containerized applications.

As OpenShift is a distribution of Kubernetes, there will be Kubernetes concepts
used throughout this workshop. The workshop assumes that attendees will have knowledge
of Kubernetes fundamental concepts.
