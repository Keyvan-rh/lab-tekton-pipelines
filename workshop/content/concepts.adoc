Tekton defines a number of link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Kubernetes custom resources]
as building blocks in order to standardize pipeline concepts and provide a terminology
that is consistent across CI/CD solutions. These custom resources are an extension of the
Kubernetes API that let users create and interact with these objects using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), `kubectl`, and other Kubernetes tools.

The custom resources needed to define a pipeline are listed below:

* `Task`: a reusable, loosely coupled number of steps that perform a specific task (e.g. building a container image)
* `Pipeline`: the definition of the pipeline and the tasks that it should perform
* `PipelineResource`: inputs (e.g. git repository) and outputs (e.g. image registry) to and out of a pipeline or task
* `TaskRun`: the execution and result (i.e. success or failure) of running an instance of task
* `PipelineRun`: the execution and result (i.e. success or failure) of running a pipeline

In short, in order to create a pipeline, one does the following:

* Create custom or install link:https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[existing] reusable Tasks
* Create a Pipeline and PipelineResources to define your application's delivery Pipeline
* Create a PipelineRun to instantiate and invoke the Pipeline

For further details on pipeline concepts, refer to the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/docs#learn-more[Tekton documentation]
that provides an excellent guide for understanding various parameters and attributes available for defining pipelines.

In the following sections, you will go through each of the above steps to define and execute a pipeline.
