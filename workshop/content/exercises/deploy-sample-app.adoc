For this tutorial, you're going to use a simple Node.js application. The workshop
is configured to provide you a pre-created OpenShift project (i.e., Kubernetes namespace)
where you will set up supplementary resources for your application for its eventual
deployment.

We can verify the name of the project with:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc project -q
----

You will use the link:https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex[nodejs-ex] sample application during this tutorial,
which is a simple Node.js application.

To prepare for nodejs-ex's eventual deployment, you will create Kubernetes objects that
are supplementary to the application, such as a route (i.e. url). The deployment will not
complete since there are no container images built for the nodejs-ex application yet.
That you will do in the following sections through a CI/CD pipeline.

Create the supplementary Kubernetes objects by running the command below:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f sampleapp/sampleapp.yaml
----

To verify the resources needed to support nodejs-ex have been created, you can head
out to the OpenShift web console.

**NOTE:** An error message may appear when you first visit the console due to the fact that your
user for this workshop does not have permissions to view projects other than your own. The web console
may start on a different project other than the one you are using for this workshop, but all you will need
to do is follow the instructions below to navigate to your project.

You can make your way to the web console by clicking on the **Console** tab next to the
**Terminal** tab at the center top of the workshop in your browser.

Make sure the **Developer** option from the dropdown in the top left corner of the web console
is selected as shown below:

Next, select the Project dropdown menu shown below and choose the project namespace you have
been working with. As a reminder, the project you are using is **%project_namespace%** and this
will differ from what is shown in the photo below:

Next, click on the **Topology** tab on the left side of the web console if you don't
see the what's in the image below. Once in the **Topology** view, you can see the deployment
config for the nodejs-ex application, which is what is shown in the image below:

image:../images/topology-view.png[Topology View]

You'll notice the white circle around the nodejs-ex deployment config. This means
that nothing is actually running yet in your OpenShift project.

Head back over to the terminal by clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console**
tab that you used to get the web console.

In the next section, you'll learn how to use Tekton tasks. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
