Now that you have kicked off your pipeline execution, you can view it in the **Pipelines**
tab of the OpenShift web console. Click on the **Console** tab at the center top of the
workshop in your browser to head back out to the web console.

Once back in the web console, you should be on the **Pipelines** tab that will show
you the current pipelinerun for deploy-pipeline, which will be similar to what is shown
below:

To view the current pipelinerun, click on the pipelinerun name under the **Last Run** column.

After clicking on the pipelinerun name, you should see the tasks as part of
your pipeline executing similar to whats displayed below:

By hovering your cursor over the `build` task, you can see the steps that the task
will execute. You can also do this with the `deploy` task.

To verify the pipelinerun executed successfully, head back to the terminal by
clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console** tab at the center top of
the workshop in your browser.

Once you see the successful deployment verification message shown below, you can
go out and see the application running on OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
[deploy : oc] deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/nodejs-ex rolled out
----

If you do not see the message, just wait a minute as the pipelinerun finishes and
watch the logs continue to come in from `tkn`.

You can confirm the successful deployment after the logs show the output above by
running the `tkn` command you ran earlier to list the pipelineruns:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
tkn pr ls
----

Under the `STATUS` column of the output, you should see `Succeeded` if the pipelinerun
was successful. You can also see how long the pipelinerun took to execute under the `DURATION` column.

To see the application you have deployed, click Continue to head to the next section.
